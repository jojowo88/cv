        <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p class="coding-p">My love for video games, which is what originally got me interested in programming. The more I learned about it, the more
          I realized how programming wasn't just about being analytical and logical, it had a creative side and I became more intrigued with what
          I could accomplish. I'm currently studying Python, HTML, and CSS, but I am always eager to learn new skills.</p>

        <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <p class="creative-p">I also love creative writing and storytelling, which is why outside of my regular job, I also co-founded a publishing company called ReVision Studios,
          where I'm currently the lead writer and letterer for my team's self-published debut graphic novel, <em>Midwinter</em>. Writing allows me to think of new scenarios and story ideas
          that I storyboard with my team members. These storyboard meetings allowed me to hone in on my communication skills in order to get my point across as quickly and concisely
          as possible.</p>
